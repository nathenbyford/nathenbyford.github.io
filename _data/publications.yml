  abstract: "This study investigated how surface coatings affect the antimicrobial properties of zero-valent iron nanoparticles (FeNPs). Using a bottom-up synthesis approach, FeNPs were coated with L-ascorbic acid (AA), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), then tested against six diverse bacterial species. Disc diffusion assays showed AA- and CTAB-coated FeNPs had the strongest antibacterial activity. Sensitivity varied by species, with Bacillus nealsonii being the most susceptible. Statistical models confirmed significant differences in bacterial response across coatings and concentrations, reinforcing the potential of customizable 'designer nanoparticles' for targeted antimicrobial use."
